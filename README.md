# 🧑‍💻 Student Speaking Assessment Report

This project is a frontend-focused functional prototype of a Student Speaking Assessment Report page, inspired by platforms like SpeechAce / IELTS score reports.

It displays:
- Overall speaking score
- Skill-wise scores (Pronunciation, Fluency, Vocabulary, Grammar)
- Visual representation using progress bars / charts
- Dynamic descriptive feedback based on scores

## 📊 Where the Scores Are Stored

All data is stored in a single JSON file:

```
src/reportData.json
```

This file contains:
- Student details (name, date)
- Scores for multiple frameworks:
  - SpeechAce
  - CEFR
  - IELTS
  - PTE
  - TOEFL
  - TOEIC
- Skill-wise scores for each framework
- Feedback rules for numeric and CEFR-based scoring

The frontend reads directly from this file. No database or backend is used.

## 🧠 How Feedback Logic Works

Feedback is rule-based and data-driven.

### Numeric frameworks
Scores are evaluated against ranges defined in `reportData.json`:
- Score ≥ 8 → Excellent performance
- Score 6–7 → Good performance
- Score < 6 → Needs improvement

The UI selects the first matching rule based on the score value.

---

### CEFR framework
CEFR feedback is mapped directly to level labels:
- A1 → Very limited
- A2 → Basic
- B1 → Adequate
- B2 → Good
- C1 → Advanced
- C2 → Near-native

Displayed value: CEFR level  
Progress bars: Levels are internally mapped to percentages for visualization only.
